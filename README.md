# CS7643 Deep Learning – Group Project
This repository contains the implementation and report for our CS7643: Deep Learning final group project at Georgia Tech. Our work focuses on self-supervised learning for image classification — specifically evaluating and comparing MoCo (Momentum Contrast) against other representation learning methods.
## MoCo
This is an unofficial PyTorch implementation of [MoCo: Improved Baselines with Momentum Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04297).
The official Tensorflow implementation is [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/moco).
